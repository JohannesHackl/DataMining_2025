# Data Mining (Autumn 2025) — IT University of Copenhagen

This repository contains my exercises, assignments, and final project for the **Data Mining** course in the Autumn semester of 2025 at ITU. The course is part of the MSc in Software Design program and serves as an **introduction to machine learning**, focusing on practical algorithmic approaches to extracting insights from data. Topics include classification, clustering, association rule mining, and predictive modeling using hands-on Python implementations and real-world datasets.
 
**Instructor:** Fabricio Batista Narcizo  

## Learning Objectives

- Analyze data mining problems and select appropriate algorithms
- Implement core techniques including:
  - Data pre-processing
  - Association rule mining
  - Classification and prediction
  - Clustering
- Apply both basic and advanced algorithms to real-world datasets
- Work effectively in teams and evaluate model performance

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Data Mining Toolkit:** Freely available packages + custom implementations
